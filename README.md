This is a flashcards app where a user can create an account and login. Once logged in, a user can create, view, update and delete all their flashcards. 

There is an option to generate random flashcards based on a topic entered in by a user using AI. I connected to openAI to have access to chatGPT.
The user can save any of the flashcards created by AI into their collection.

Stack used: MERN
I used Redux for the frontend to connect to my backend API.
